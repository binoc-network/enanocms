CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE
-----------------------------

Please see <http://enanocms.org/Release_notes/1.1.7> for a list of changes in
this release.

UPGRADING FROM PREVIOUS RELEASES
-----------------------------

This archive includes a script that can migrate an Enano 1.0.x installation to
Enano 1.2. Before running the migration script, you should always be sure to
upgrade to the latest version of Enano 1.0.x (1.0.7 "FIXME" at the time of
this writing). Migration is NOT REVERSIBLE. This is beta-quality code. DO NOT
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES UPGRADE A PRODUCTION SITE.

Upgrades from any 1.1.x version are fully supported and generally more stable
than upgrades from 1.0 because of all the API changes. If you experience
trouble upgrading from a 1.0 version to 1.2, try upgrading first to version
1.1.6 or so.

TRANSLATING ENANO
-----------------------------

There have been quite a few changes to strings in the 1.2 series. Since this
is a beta, you probably don't want to do a lot of translation because you'll
be doing a TON more strings at every release. HOWEVER, we're looking for
people to sign up and volunteer for translation efforts later on. If you have
a native or very good knowledge of a language, drop us an e-mail and we'll get
you onto the translator list and eventually onto a mailing list specifically
for l10n if that effort becomes big enough.

PLUG-INS
-----------------------------

Most Enano features you see are actually the work of plugins. You can see a
gallery of plugins at <http://enanocms.org/Category:Plugins>. Most of the
plugins there work under Enano 1.2, but some don't. Plugins with known
compatibility problems are marked; if you don't see any notes to the
contrary, it's probably compatible with Enano 1.2.

THEMES
-----------------------------

You can find more themes for Enano at <http://enanocms.org/Category:Themes>.
We're not doing too great with developing themes, and what we have developed
often doesn't make it up to the website. :) So your choices on the website
look a little bit more limited than they really are.

Unlike plugins, themes are generally very easy to port from 1.0 to 1.2. Copy
over acledit.tpl, comment.tpl, and toolbar.tpl from a 1.2 theme and remove
the <script> tag that includes jsres.php, replacing it with {JS_HEADER} in
header.tpl. Then put {JS_FOOTER} right before </body> in footer.tpl. Do the
same in simple_header.tpl and simple_footer.tpl. That's pretty much it.

PLUGIN DEVELOPMENT
-----------------------------

The plugin API in Enano 1.1 has been dramatically revamped from 1.0. Some
effort has been made to allow 1.0.x plugins that don't hook very deeply to
continue to work; however with all of the new functionality (localization
especially) we recommend that developers take the time to learn how to use the
newer parts of the Enano platform. Enano tries to be very developer-friendly;
our full API documentation is at <http://docs.enanocms.org/API>.

GETTING SUPPORT
-----------------------------

This is a beta release. No support of any kind will be provided, but proper bug
reports are appreciated. See the Enano forums at <http://forum.enanocms.org/>
for more information.

Have fun with Enano!
