Most of the PHP code in Enano was written by Dan Fuhry. Some parts were borrowed
from other projects that are also released under Free licenses; see the various
files under the licenses/ directory included with this release for details.

If you are planning to make a commercial fork of Enano, all of the software and
libraries included with Enano are available under licenses that allow you to do
so; however, in compliance with the GPL, you must:

a) provide attribution to the Enano team in source code files and on the
   (renamed) Special:About_Enano page,
b) remove all instances of the word Enano and the Enano logo from your
   derivative work, with the exception of the following phrase, which must
   be shown on the (renamed) Special:About_Enano page:

    "The software used on this website was based on Enano CMS. Copyright
     (C) 2006-2007 Dan Fuhry."

   The words "Enano CMS" must link to the page <http://enanocms.org/>. You may
   (at your option) also include a notice of non-endorsement by the Enano
   Foundation, unless you're lucky enough to become an official fork
   maintainer.

c) Provide the complete source code for your modified version of Enano under
   the terms of the GNU General Public License, and
d) Include the complete and unmodified licenses/ directory, which contains
   licensing information for third-party libraries that Enano uses.

As permitted by the GPL, you may charge for the service of downloading Enano
from your server; however, you may not prevent others from distributing Enano
or any modified version.

CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE
-----------------------------

Please see <http://enanocms.org/Release_notes/1.1.2> for a list of changes in
this release.

UPGRADING FROM PREVIOUS RELEASES
-----------------------------

This tarball includes a very basic migration script that you can use to change
a 1.0.x installation into a 1.1.x one. Make sure you're using the latest 1.0.x
release (1.0.3 at the time of this writing) BEFORE you run the migration
script. DO NOT UPGRADE A PRODUCTION SITE.

As of 1.1.2, basic upgrade functionality is included and is considered highly
experimental. Back up your entire database and Enano root before upgrading.

TRANSLATING ENANO
-----------------------------

This is the only the second formal release of Enano that is localized. Right
now since this is an alpha, you probably don't want to do any translation
because you'll be doing a TON more strings at every release. HOWEVER, we're
looking for people to sign up and volunteer for translation efforts later on.
If you have a native or very good knowledge of a language, drop us an e-mail
and we'll get you onto the translator list and eventually onto a mailing list
specifically for l10n.

EXPANDING YOUR SITE'S CAPABILITIES
-----------------------------

There is a gallery of plugins for Enano at
<http://enanocms.org/Category:Plugins>. It's not very full right now because
not every plugin has a page on the website yet, and some plugins still have
yet to be ported to work with some of the newer API changes. Being an alpha
release you'll probably need to look in the Mercurial repositories at
<http://hg.enanocms.org/> for the latest versions of plugins that are designed
to work under both 1.0.x and 1.1.x.

GIVING YOUR SITE A NEW LOOK
-----------------------------

You can find more themes for Enano at <http://enanocms.org/Category:Themes>.
Again, we're still working on packaging up themes and creating pages for them,
so try to be patient. We have quite a few themes in the works. You can create
your own themes too; for more information, see Chapter V of the Enano
Administrator's handbook, at <http://docs.enanocms.org/Help:5>. Unless
specifically marked, themes on the Enano website are compatible with 1.0.x.
While you can use 1.0.x themes under 1.1.x, some features (namely viewing IPs
on comments and the default "Inherit" option in the ACL editor) will be missing
unless you copy over comment.tpl and acledit.tpl respectively from Oxygen or
one of the other themes included with this 1.1.x package.

GETTING SUPPORT
-----------------------------

This is an alpha release. No support of any kind will be provided, but proper
bug reports are appreciated. See the Enano forums at
<http://forum.enanocms.org/> for more information.

Have fun with Enano!
