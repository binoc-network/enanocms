MODIFIED DISTRIBUTIONS / FORKS
-----------------------------

Please note that the Enano team does not provide any support for modified or
"modded" releases. So if you modify the Enano sources at all, you will not
receive any support from official sources. If you distribute your modified
versions, providing support is entirely up to you. You also must remove any
links to official Enano support channels contained in the source code if you
distribute any modified version of Enano. We also respectfully request that you
not call any modified distributions "Enano" or any deviation thereof; while the
term "Enano" is not a registered trademark, we do ask that you respect it.

Please note that the official Enano artwork is copyrighted and not under the
GPL. If you distribute any modified version of Enano, you must change the
artwork. (If you're seeking to include Enano as part of a larger software
distribution, such as GNU/Linux or BSD, e-mail Dan for special terms.)

As permitted by the GPL, you may charge for the service of downloading Enano
from your server; however, you may not prevent others from distributing Enano
or any modified version.

CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE
-----------------------------

Please see <http://enanocms.org/Release_notes/1.1.5> for a list of changes in
this release.

UPGRADING FROM PREVIOUS RELEASES
-----------------------------

This archive includes a script that can migrate an Enano 1.0.x installation to
Enano 1.1. Before running the migration script, you should always be sure to
upgrade to the latest version of Enano 1.0.x (1.0.4 "Ellyyllon" at the time of
this writing). Migration is NOT REVERSIBLE. This is alpha-quality code. DO NOT
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES UPGRADE A PRODUCTION SITE.

As of Enano 1.1.2, upgrades from previous 1.1.x versions are supported. The API
is considered fairly stable as of 1.1.4, but the interface is still a work in
progress except for the installer UI core, which is quite close to final.

TRANSLATING ENANO
-----------------------------

This is the only the fifth formal release of Enano that is localized. Right
now since this is an alpha, you probably don't want to do any translation
because you'll be doing a TON more strings at every release. HOWEVER, we're
looking for people to sign up and volunteer for translation efforts later on.
If you have a native or very good knowledge of a language, drop us an e-mail
and we'll get you onto the translator list and eventually onto a mailing list
specifically for l10n.

EXPANDING YOUR SITE'S CAPABILITIES
-----------------------------

There is a gallery of plugins for Enano at
<http://enanocms.org/Category:Plugins>. It's not very full right now because
not every plugin has a page on the website yet, and some plugins still have
yet to be ported to work with some of the newer API changes. Being an alpha
release you'll probably need to look in the Mercurial repositories at
<http://hg.enanocms.org/> for the latest versions of plugins that are designed
to work under both 1.0.x and 1.1.x.

GIVING YOUR SITE A NEW LOOK
-----------------------------

You can find more themes for Enano at <http://enanocms.org/Category:Themes>.
Again, we're still working on packaging up themes and creating pages for them,
so try to be patient. We have quite a few themes in the works. You can create
your own themes too; for more information, see Chapter V of the Enano
Administrator's handbook, at <http://docs.enanocms.org/Help:5>. Unless
specifically marked, themes on the Enano website are compatible with 1.0.x.
While you can use 1.0.x themes under 1.1.x, some features (namely viewing IPs
on comments and the default "Inherit" option in the ACL editor) will be missing
unless you copy over comment.tpl and acledit.tpl respectively from Oxygen or
one of the other themes included with this 1.1.x package.

PLUGIN DEVELOPMENT
-----------------------------

The plugin API in Enano 1.1 has been dramatically revamped from 1.0. Some
effort has been made to allow 1.0.x plugins that don't hook very deeply to
continue to work; however with all of the new functionality (localization
especially) we recommend that developers take the time to learn how to use the
new plugin management platform. This system is fully documented in the large
comment block in plugins/admin/PluginManager.php.

GETTING SUPPORT
-----------------------------

This is an alpha release. No support of any kind will be provided, but proper
bug reports are appreciated. See the Enano forums at
<http://forum.enanocms.org/> for more information.

Have fun with Enano!
