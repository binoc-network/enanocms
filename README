Most of the PHP code in Enano was written by Dan Fuhry. Some parts were borrowed
from other projects that are also released under Free licenses; see the various
files under the licenses/ directory included with this release for details.

Please be reminded that if you create a commercial fork of Enano, that while
all of the components included with Enano are licensed in such a way that you
are allowed to do so, you must make the project in its entirety available under
the GNU General Public License, notwithstanding licenses for specific
components of Enano named in /licenses/index.html and in various source code
files.

We also ask that if you fork Enano, you provide attribution to the Enano team
by including the following notice on the (renamed) Special:About_Enano page:

  "This software is based on Enano CMS, copyright (C) 2006-2008 Dan Fuhry."

While you have no legal obligation to do so, we ask that any forks of Enano
be renamed so that they do not contain the word "Enano" anywhere in the
product name. This is for identity and support reasons - users may get
confused as to which one is the "real" Enano CMS. We also strongly recommend
that you include a notice of non-endorsement from Dan Fuhry and the Enano
Foundation and a disclaimer of liability for damages incurred through the use
of the software. The Enano Team will not provide support for forks.

As permitted by the GPL, you may charge for the service of downloading Enano
from your server; however, you may not prevent others from distributing Enano
or any modified version.

CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE
-----------------------------

Please see <http://enanocms.org/Release_notes/1.1.5> for a list of changes in
this release.

UPGRADING FROM PREVIOUS RELEASES
-----------------------------

This archive includes a script that can migrate an Enano 1.0.x installation to
Enano 1.1. Before running the migration script, you should always be sure to
upgrade to the latest version of Enano 1.0.x (1.0.4 "Ellyyllon" at the time of
this writing). Migration is NOT REVERSIBLE. This is alpha-quality code. DO NOT
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES UPGRADE A PRODUCTION SITE.

As of Enano 1.1.2, upgrades from previous 1.1.x versions are supported. The API
is considered fairly stable as of 1.1.4, but the interface is still a work in
progress except for the installer UI core, which is quite close to final.

TRANSLATING ENANO
-----------------------------

This is the only the fifth formal release of Enano that is localized. Right
now since this is an alpha, you probably don't want to do any translation
because you'll be doing a TON more strings at every release. HOWEVER, we're
looking for people to sign up and volunteer for translation efforts later on.
If you have a native or very good knowledge of a language, drop us an e-mail
and we'll get you onto the translator list and eventually onto a mailing list
specifically for l10n.

EXPANDING YOUR SITE'S CAPABILITIES
-----------------------------

There is a gallery of plugins for Enano at
<http://enanocms.org/Category:Plugins>. It's not very full right now because
not every plugin has a page on the website yet, and some plugins still have
yet to be ported to work with some of the newer API changes. Being an alpha
release you'll probably need to look in the Mercurial repositories at
<http://hg.enanocms.org/> for the latest versions of plugins that are designed
to work under both 1.0.x and 1.1.x.

GIVING YOUR SITE A NEW LOOK
-----------------------------

You can find more themes for Enano at <http://enanocms.org/Category:Themes>.
Again, we're still working on packaging up themes and creating pages for them,
so try to be patient. We have quite a few themes in the works. You can create
your own themes too; for more information, see Chapter V of the Enano
Administrator's handbook, at <http://docs.enanocms.org/Help:5>. Unless
specifically marked, themes on the Enano website are compatible with 1.0.x.
While you can use 1.0.x themes under 1.1.x, some features (namely viewing IPs
on comments and the default "Inherit" option in the ACL editor) will be missing
unless you copy over comment.tpl and acledit.tpl respectively from Oxygen or
one of the other themes included with this 1.1.x package.

PLUGIN DEVELOPMENT
-----------------------------

The plugin API in Enano 1.1 has been dramatically revamped from 1.0. Some
effort has been made to allow 1.0.x plugins that don't hook very deeply to
continue to work; however with all of the new functionality (localization
especially) we recommend that developers take the time to learn how to use the
new plugin management platform. This system is fully documented in the large
comment block in plugins/admin/PluginManager.php.

GETTING SUPPORT
-----------------------------

This is an alpha release. No support of any kind will be provided, but proper
bug reports are appreciated. See the Enano forums at
<http://forum.enanocms.org/> for more information.

Have fun with Enano!
