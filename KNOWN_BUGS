Enano 1.1.5 - Known Bugs and Issues

  These are the issues in Enano 1.1.5 that the development team knows
  about, but did not have time to fix before this release was
  scheduled. Hopefully all of these will be fixed in the next release.

- Despite this being an alpha, the team doesn't know of any bugs per
  se in all of Enano. WTF?? Yeah, right. Help us find 'em and post
  on the forum or drop by #enano on freenode.
