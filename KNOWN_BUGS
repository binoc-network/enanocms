Enano 1.1.4 - Known Bugs and Issues

  These are the issues in Enano 1.1.4 that the development team knows
  about, but did not have time to fix before this release was
  scheduled. Hopefully all of these will be fixed in the next release.

- Username and page name auto-complation does not work
  These components were moved to a new framework - Spry data sets - in
  Enano 1.1.4. We're having a lot of issues with this due to the
  requirement for loading the data only on demand (e.g. when the user
  starts typing in the form field). We also need to be able to create
  username autocompletion fields with DHTML, which spry is also
  failing at. Now if only Spry's effects library wasn't so damn nice,
  we'd probably swap it out for something else entirely.

- Several expected ACL management features are missing
  We know, we know. You want ACL presets and more ways to debug
  existing rules. The good news is that the latter is fully implemented
  on the backend level. The bad news is that creating a good frontend
  is a hard thing especially with the standard that the existing ACL
  editor sets. We'll have both presets and ACL rule tracing done for
  Enano 1.1.5.
