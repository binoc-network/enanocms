Enano 1.1.5 - Known Bugs and Issues

  These are the issues in Enano 1.1.6 that the development team knows
  about, but did not have time to fix before this release was
  scheduled. Hopefully all of these will be fixed in the next release.

- Internet Explorer support is a disaster. We do care, but we don't
  act like the project depends on it. Most of Enano's IE woes are
  in Javascript stuff which means admin tools, and we hope that
  sensible administrators will use a browser other than IE.
  
  Plus, we're slowly moving over to jQuery which is much more IE-
  friendly than our own in-house libraries.
