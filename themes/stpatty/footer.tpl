    <h2>Your browser does not support CSS.</h2>
     <p>If you can see this text, it means that your browser does not support Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). CSS is a fundemental aspect of XHTML, and as a result it is becoming very widely adopted by websites, including this one. You should consider switching to a more modern web browser, such as Mozilla Firefox or Opera 9.</p>
     <p>Because of this, there are a few minor issues that you may experience while browsing this site, not the least of which is some visual elements below that would normally be hidden in most browsers. Please excuse these minor inconveniences.</p>
