If you do not have the MySQL extension installed, you will need to either use your distribution\'s package manager to install it, or you will have to compile PHP from source. If you compile PHP from source, please remember to use the "--with-mysql" configure option, and you will have to have the MySQL development files installed (they usually are). If this is not your server, please contact your hosting company and ask them to install the PHP MySQL extension.',

Enano needs to be able to write to this file in order to install.<br /><br /><b>If you are installing Enano on a SourceForge web site:</b><br />SourceForge mounts the web partitions read-only now, so you will need to use the project shell service to symlink config.php to a file in the /tmp/persistent directory.',
      req_desc_magick: 'Enano uses ImageMagick to scale images into thumbnails. Because ImageMagick was not found on your server, Enano will use the width= and height= attributes on the &lt;img&gt; tag to scale images. This can cause somewhat of a performance increase, but bandwidth usage will be higher, especially if you use high-resolution images on your site.<br /><br />If you are sure that you have ImageMagick, you can set the location of the "convert" program using the administration panel after installation is complete.',
      req_desc_cachewriteable: 'Apparently the cache/ directory is not writable. Enano will still work, but you will not be able to cache thumbnails, meaning the server will need to re-render them each time they are requested. In some cases, this can cause a significant slowdown.',
