										Also, you should avoid using output buffering functions (ob_[start|end|get_contents|clean]) here, because Enano uses those to track output from this script.

									<p>
										The standard &lt;?php and ?&gt; tags work here, but don\'t use an initial "&lt;?php" or it will cause a parse error.

										PHP code:
									</p>',
			field_plugin: '<p>Plugin:</p>',
			btn_create_block: 'Create new block',
			
			msg_block_moved: 'Item moved.',
			msg_block_deleted: 'Item deleted.',
			msg_plugin_not_loaded: 'Plugin isn\'t loaded',
			msg_order_saved: 'Sidebar order saved.',
			note_block_unnamed: 'Unnamed',
			hint_rename: 'Double-click to rename this block',
			note_block_disabled: '(disabled)',
			tip_disenable: 'Toggle',
			tip_edit: 'Edit block',
			tip_delete: 'Delete',
			tip_rename: 'Rename',
			msg_delete_confirm_title: 'Delete block',
			msg_delete_confirm_body: 'Are you sure you want to delete this sidebar block?',
			btn_delete_confirm: 'Delete block',
			btn_revert: 'Revert',
			btn_create_new_stage1: 'Create new block',
			btn_main_page: 'Main Page',
			msg_cant_edit_plugin_title: 'This block cannot be edited.',
			msg_cant_edit_plugin_body: 'This is a plugin block, and cannot be edited. <%close_link%>Close</a>',
			btn_edit_save: 'save',
			btn_edit_cancel: 'cancel',
			msg_discard_confirm: 'Do you really want to discard your changes?',
			msg_discard_order_confirm: 'Do you really want to revert your changes?\nNote: this does not revert edits or deletions, those are saved as soon as you confirm the action.',

// All done! :-)
